No-Console.js is used for blocking people from accessing:

- Developer Tools, [ F12 ]
- Javascript Console, [ CTRL + SHIFT + J ]
- Inspect Elements,  [ CTRL + SHIFT + I ]
- View Page Source, [ CTRL + U ]
- Save Page Source, [ CTRL+ S ]
- Context Menu; [ Right Click]

or logging the user ip and the event with discord webhook API.

Since this is a new (and also my first) repository, there might be a lot of bugs as you've expected, I will try to fix them.
Thanks for using No-Console.js
